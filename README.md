A random collection of notes and exercises done while reading [Programming Collective Intelligence](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321/) by [Toby Segaran](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/2972).

Some of source code is partially or completely taken from the [book examples](https://github.com/arthur-e/Programming-Collective-Intelligence) and modified or modernized according to my mood at that moment :-).
