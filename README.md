<p align="center"><img src="https://covers.oreillystatic.com/images/9780596529321/lrg.jpg" alt="cover" width="200"/></p>

Book's scripts and data together with a random collection of notes and exercises from [Programming Collective Intelligence](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321/) by [Toby Segaran](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/2972).

Some of source code is partially or completely taken from the [book examples](https://github.com/arthur-e/Programming-Collective-Intelligence) and adapted or modernized according to my mood at that moment :-).

- ``ch* - */`` a folder per chapter
  - ``data/`` folders include data files managed under [dvc]
  - ``requirements.txt`` : python dependencies ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## Requirements

- [git] and [dvc] for version control of code and data (latter already included in ``requirements-dev.txt``)
- GNU [make]
- python (see [.python-version](.python-version))
  - ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` every chapter
